Feature: Audit log enablement and validation of Oracle databases using the RDS Audit Log API

#    Scenario Outline: Positive Scenario - Successful audit log Enablement of RDS Oracle instance
#        Given POST API /v1/rdsauditlog exists
#            And an authorized user makes the API call
#            And an account exists
#            And instance exists with details <database_identifier>, <engine>, <version>, <port>, <user>, log_destination
#        When we invoke POST API /v1/rdsauditlog
#            Then API response contains a status code of 200
#            And response contains the enablement success message
#            And response contains the Step Function execution ARN which does the validation
#            And the Step Function instance is running
#            And the Step Function executes successfully to validate the audit setup
#            And <log_destination> contains details about who performed action and at what time
#        Examples:
#            | database_identifier   | engine        |  port  |  user       |  version  |  log_destination |
#            | oracle19              | oracle        |  1521  |  admin      |  19.0.0.0 |      Cloudwatch  |
##            | oracle12-2            | oracle        |  1521  |  admin      |  12.2.0.1 |      Cloudwatch  |
